<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Alok Ranjan and I am a web developer with two years of professional experience. 
  I am thrilled to introduce myself as someone who is passionate about creating engaging and innovative web solutions. 
  Over the past two years, I have been actively involved in various web development projects, honing my skills and gaining 
  valuable insights into the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

<p>My experience includes front-end development, where I specialize in crafting user-friendly and visually appealing 
  interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a keen eye for design and ensure that every element on the web page 
  not only functions flawlessly but also enhances the overall user experience.</p>

<p>Outside of professional career, I love playing cricket and going outside for hiking and camping. </p>
